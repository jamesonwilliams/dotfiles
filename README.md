# dotfiles
Jameson's . (dot) files for UNIX and Linux family command-line
environments.

One goal of these dot files is to converge on a similar experience
across some different UNIX/Linux systems that we encounter in the wild:

 * Ubuntu
 * Debian
 * RHEL
 * Amazon Linux
 * Mac OS X
 * etc.

## Setup

To install the dot files for a particular user on your system, do:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesonwilliams/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/install.sh
```
